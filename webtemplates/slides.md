# Web templates: Slideshow

### What is slide?
**Answers:** A "slideshow" on a website, also called a "slider," is a feature where multiple images or pieces of
content are displayed one at a time in a rotating sequence, usually cycling automatically after a set time or when 
a user interacts with navigation buttons, allowing for a visually engaging way to showcase various information on 
a single webpage.

### When to use?
**Answer:** Use a slideshow on a website when you want to showcase a collection of visually appealing content
like product variations, highlight multiple featured items, present a gallery of images, or quickly introduce 
key information on a homepage.
