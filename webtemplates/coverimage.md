# Web template: Cover image

### What is a cover image?
**Answer:** A cover image on a website is a large, prominent image displayed at the very top of a webpage, 
often acting as the first visual impression visitors see when they land on the site.

### When to use?
**Answer:** Use a cover image on a website when you want to visually introduce a new section of a page,
highlight a key topic or promotion, create a strong first impression, establish brand identity,
or simply add a visually appealing background to a specific area of your website, often at the 
top of a page or within a blog post to break up content and draw attention to a particular subject.
