# Web template: Discussions

### What is discussions?
**Answer:** Discussions on a website refers to a section or feature where users can engage in conversations by 
posting messages, sharing opinions, and asking questions about a specific topic, essentially creating an online 
forum where people can interact and exchange ideas with one another; it's a platform for open dialogue and 
community building. 

### When to use Discussions?
**Answer:** Use discussions on a website when you want to foster community engagement, gather feedback from users, 
facilitate knowledge sharing, encourage open dialogue around a topic, and create a platform for users to interact 
with each other and the brand, particularly when dealing with complex or nuanced subjects where multiple
perspectives are valuable.
