# Web templates: Section with cards

### What are cards?
**Answer:** Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for 
relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that 
clearly indicates hierarchy.

### When to use them?
**Answer:** Use cards on a website when you want to display a collection of related, independent pieces of information in a visually 
distinct way, particularly when users are likely to be browsing through content rather than actively searching for 
specific details; essentially, cards are ideal for presenting "teasers" that link to deeper content on your site.
